# Chef's Vision (Recipe Sharing Website)
## Case Study

"It's been a while that I don't know what to cook for lunch. I'm always eating the same indian food everyday. One day, I wish I had someone telling me what to cook different and eat today."

This was what I kept telling myself every single day. Sometimes I search recipes on Instagram, sometime on google but am always find more videos than written recipes, but I was looking for a more structured and organized plan.

I made up my mind to build recipe sharing website where I can go to find delicious and new recipes shared by other users as a written content because some user are not comfortable making videos to share their recipes.
In school, I learned PHP, mySQL database and how to interact with database. So I decided to use PHP as a backend and mySQL database to store all the data. I added comments on recipe feature to appreciate to user of recipe and to provide reviews about recipe. 

## Thought Process
* This application needs a name related to food. I searched for name and ended up having name Chef's Vision.
* Then I choosed color combination.
* I started thinking about design and created wireframes for getting ideasabout interface.
* Then I started coding and developing the project.
